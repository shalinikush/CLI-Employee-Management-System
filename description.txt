This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Employee Management System built using Node.js. The application allows users to manage a list of employees in memory using arrays, without the need for any external database.
Add Employee – Enter employee name and ID, then store it in an array.

List Employees – Display all the employees stored in memory.

Remove Employee – Delete an employee by providing their ID.

Exit – Quit the application.
It uses Node.js readline module to handle user input from the terminal and demonstrates the fundamentals of array operations, CRUD logic, and CLI-based applications.



How It Works:

The program starts by displaying a menu in the terminal.

The user selects an option (1–4).

Based on the choice:

Add → Prompts for employee details and pushes them into an array.

List → Iterates over the array and prints all employees.

Remove → Finds an employee by ID and removes them using array methods.

Exit → Gracefully ends the session.
